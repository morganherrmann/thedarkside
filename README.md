TO RUN DEMO SO FAR

Click the link, and load the page. Wait about 5 seconds just to make sure everything is loaded.

Press the "w" key on your keyboard. *Music woohoo*

For now, I simply have alternating shaders that change in time to the song.  
Took quite some time to get the timing right using different javascript APIs for music.... 

So now I have all of the timing set up, as well as about 25 shader files to work with that change in perfect time with the song.
The structure is all there and now I can spend my time on the shaders themselves- wanted to get the more technical not-as-fun issues out of the way first!
