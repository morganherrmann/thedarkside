# Procedural Graphics  - Final Project

### Inspired by Simulation Theory, by Muse

### PROJECT STATEMENT

For this project, I aimed to create a real-time music video for an existing song, using data such as BPM to drive the motion of the shaders and scenes.

#### GOALS

1) Create a real-time set of shaders that render in time to a music video.
2) Maintain a clear art-direction, using the music video as an artistic inspiration.
3) Incorporate inspiration from the artwork of existing album covers.

#### INSPIRATION BACKGROUND

This project is heavily art-based, relying on executing the visual aesthetic of the band.  MUSE is recognized worldwide for their incredible light shows in live performances, and musical themes surrounding dystopian futures, biological warfare, and computer simulations.  Imagery seen in their music videos involves everything from microscopic visuals, to cyberpunk graphics.

Some of their album covers can be seen below.

While incorporating some of these designs to pay an homage to previous albums, their newest - "Simulation Theory", seen below-- is the primary artistic inspiration for this project.

TO RUN DEMO SO FAR

Click the link, and load the page. Wait about 5 seconds just to make sure everything is loaded.

Press the "w" key on your keyboard. *Music woohoo*

For now, I simply have alternating shaders that change in time to the song.  
Took quite some time to get the timing right using different javascript APIs for music.... 

So now I have all of the timing set up, as well as about 25 shader files to work with that change in perfect time with the song.
The structure is all there and now I can spend my time on the shaders themselves- wanted to get the more technical not-as-fun issues out of the way first!
